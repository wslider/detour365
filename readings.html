            <section class="episode-readings-section">
            <h3 class="readings-scriptures"></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>John 20:11-18 NIV<br>
                [11] Now Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb<br>
                [12] and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus’ body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.<br>
                [13] They asked her, “Woman, why are you crying?”<br>
                “They have taken my Lord away,” she said, “and I don’t know where they have put him.”<br>
                [14] At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.<br>
                [15] He asked her, “Woman, why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?”<br>
                Thinking he was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him.”<br>
                [16] Jesus said to her, “Mary.”<br>
                She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, “Rabboni!” (which means “Teacher”).<br>
                [17] Jesus said, “Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”<br>
                [18] Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them that he had said these things to her.</li>

                <li>Luke 24:13-35 NIV<br>
                [13] Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.<br>
                [14] They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.<br>
                [15] As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them;<br>
                [16] but they were kept from recognizing him.<br>
                [17] He asked them, “What are you discussing together as you walk along?”<br>
                They stood still, their faces downcast.<br>
                [18] One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?”<br>
                [19] “What things?” he asked.<br>
                “About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.<br>
                [20] The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him;<br>
                [21] but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.<br>
                [22] In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning<br>
                [23] but didn’t find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.<br>
                [24] Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.”<br>
                [25] He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!<br>
                [26] Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?”<br>
                [27] And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.<br>
                [28] As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as if he were going farther.<br>
                [29] But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them.<br>
                [30] When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.<br>
                [31] Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight.<br>
                [32] They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”<br>
                [33] They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together<br>
                [34] and saying, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.”<br>
                [35] Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.</li>

            <section class="episode-readings-section">
            <h3 class="readings-scriptures"></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Genesis 2:1-3 NIV<br>
                [1] Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.<br>
                [2] And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. [3] So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.</li>

                <li>Genesis 3:8-9 ESV<br>
                [8] And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. [9] But the Lord God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?” </li>

                <li>Genesis 5:21-24 ESV<br>
                [21] When Enoch had lived 65 years, he fathered Methuselah. [22] Enoch walked with God after he fathered Methuselah 300 years and had other sons and daughters. [23] Thus all the days of Enoch were 365 years. [24] Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.</li>

                <li>Genesis 6:1-8 ESV<br>
                [1] When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them, [2] the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose. [3] Then the Lord said, “My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years.” [4] The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown. [5]  The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. [6] And the Lord regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. [7] So the Lord said, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.” [8] But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.</li>


                <li>Genesis 11:4-9 ESV<br>
                [4] Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.” [5] And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built. [6] And the Lord said, “Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. [7] Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another’s speech.” [8] So the Lord dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. [9] Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth. And from there the Lord dispersed them over the face of all the earth.</li>


                <li>Genesis 32:30 ESV<br>
                [30] So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, “For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered.”</li>

                <li>Exodus 3:2-4 ESV<br>
                [2] And the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed. [3] And Moses said, “I will turn aside to see this great sight, why the bush is not burned.” [4] When the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.”</li>

                <li>Exodus 11:9-10 ESV<br>
                [9] Then the Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.” [10] Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the people of Israel go out of his land.</li>

                <li>Exodus 24:9-11 ESV<br>
                [9] Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up, [10] and they saw the God of Israel. There was under his feet as it were a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness. [11] And he did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel; they beheld God, and ate and drank.</li>


                <li>Exodus 33:11 ESV<br>
                [11] Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. When Moses turned again into the camp, his assistant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent. </li>

                <li>Exodus 33:21-23 ESV<br>
                [21] And the Lord said, “Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock, [22] and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by. [23] Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen.”</li>

                <li>Exodus 34:5-7 ESV<br>
                [5] The Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord. [6] The Lord passed before him and proclaimed, “The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, [7] keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children’s children, to the third and the fourth generation.” </li>


                <li>Job 1:8 ESV<br>
                [8] And the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?” </li>

                <li>1 Kings 19:11-13 ESV<br>
                [11] And he said, “Go out and stand on the mount before the Lord.” And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. [12] And after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire the sound of a low whisper. [13] And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, there came a voice to him and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”</li>

                <li>Daniel 3:23-26 ESV<br>
                [23] And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace. [24] Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up in haste. He declared to his counselors, “Did we not cast three men bound into the fire?” They answered and said to the king, “True, O king.” [25] He answered and said, “But I see four men unbound, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.” [26] Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace; he declared, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here!” Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the fire.</li>
